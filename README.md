cocos2d-as
==========

cocos2d-as is a multi-platform framework for building 2d games, interactive books, 
demos and other graphical applications. It is based on cocos2d-iphone, but instead 
of using Objective-C, it uses actionscript 3.0. As cocos2d-as is built on top of 
Adobe's Flashâ„¢ technology, it runs not only in the browser, but on all major mobile 
platforms out there, including iOS and Android.
